Do not report security issues in this bug tracker. Instead, contact security@syncthing.net directly - see https://syncthing.net/security.html for more information.

If your issue is a support request ("How do I get my devices to connect?" or similar), please use the support forum at https://forum.syncthing.net/ where a large number of helpful people hang out. This issue tracker is for reporting bugs or feature requests directly to the developers.

If your issue is a bug report, replace this boilerplate with a description of the problem, being sure to include at least:

    what happened,
    what you expected to happen instead, and
    any steps to reproduce the problem.

Also fill out the version information below and add log output or screenshots as appropriate.

Do not file a feature request unless you want to implement it yourself. This is
due to the maintenance status of this project, see [the readme for
context](./README.md#status-maintenance-mode---co-maintainers-welcome).
