# Building

### Requirements
- Android SDK Platform (for the `compileSdkVersion` specified in [build.gradle](build.gradle))
- Android Support Repository

### Build instructions

Use `./gradlew assembleDebug` in the project directory to compile the APK.

To check for updated gradle dependencies, run `gradle dependencyUpdates`. Additionally, the git submodule in `ext/syncthing/src/github.com/syncthing/syncthing` may need to be updated.


### Building on Windows

To build the Syncthing app on Windows we need to include the native Syncthing binaries:
- Download the `syncthing-linux-386` and `syncthing-linux-arm` archives from [Syncthing releases](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/releases) and extract them. In each there is a `syncthing` executable. Rename and place both of these to `libs/x86/libsyncthing.so` and `libs/armeabi/libsyncthing.so` respectively.  
You will also need to replace the standard `build.gradle` file with [this one](https://gist.github.com/Moter8/9cfc191434d1989d86be).


### Development Notes

It is recommended to change the GUI and Listen Address ports for the debug app, eg to 8385 and 22001 respectively.

The Syncthing backend used for this android application provides a web interface by default. It can be accessed via the Settings menu -> 'Web GUI'. It is quite helpful to access this web interface from your development machine. Read [android documentation](http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html#redirection) on how to access the network of your emulator. Or use the following steps to connect to the single currently running emulator/AVD.
- `telnet localhost 5554`
- `redir add tcp:18384:8384`
- Start Syncthing app on your emulator and access the web interface from you favorite browser of your development machine via [http://127.0.0.1:18384](http://127.0.0.1:18384)
