# Goal of the forked version
- Develop and try out enhancements together
- Release the wrapper more frequently to identify and fix bugs together caused by changes in the syncthing submodule
- Make enhancements configurable in the settings UI, e.g. users should be able to turn them on and off
- Let's get ready for newer Android versions that put limits on background syncing tools. We need your bug reports as detailed as possible

# Translations

# Building

### Prerequisites
- Android SDK
`You can skip this if you are using Android Studio.`
- Android NDK r16b
`$ANDROID_NDK_HOME environment variable should point at the root directory of your NDK. If the variable is not set, build-syncthing.py will automatically try to download and setup the NDK.`
- Go 1.9.7
`Make sure, Go is installed and available on the PATH environment variable. If Go is not found on the PATH environment variable, build-syncthing.py will automatically try to download and setup GO on the PATH.`
- Python 2.7
`Make sure, Python is installed and available on the PATH environment variable.`
- Git (for Linux) or Git for Windows
`Make sure, git (or git.exe) is installed and available on the PATH environment variable. If Git is not found on the PATH environment variable, build-syncthing.py will automatically try to download and setup MinGit 2.19.0-x64 on the PATH.`
- Java Version 8 (you might need to set `$JAVA_HOME` accordingly)

### Build instructions

Make sure you clone the project with
`git clone https://github.com/Catfriend1/syncthing-android.git --recursive`.
Alternatively, run `git submodule init && git submodule update` in the project folder.

A Linux VM, for example running Debian, is recommended to build this.

Build Syncthing and the Syncthing-Android wrapper using the following commands:

`./gradlew buildNative`

`./gradlew lint assembleDebug`

You can also use Android Studio to build the apk after you manually ran the `./gradlew buildNative` command in the repository root.

To clean up all files generated during build, use the following commands:

`./gradlew cleanNative`

`./gradlew clean`

### Development Notes

It is recommended to change the GUI and Listen Address ports for the debug app, e.g. to 8385 and 22001 respectively.

The Syncthing native used for this android application provides a web interface by default. It can be accessed via the Settings menu -> 'Web GUI'. It is quite helpful to access this web interface from your development machine. Read android documentation on how to access the network of your emulator. Or use the following command to connect to the single currently running emulator/AVD.

adb forward tcp:18384 tcp:8384

Start Syncthing app on your emulator and access the web interface from you favorite browser of your development machine via https://127.0.0.1:18384
